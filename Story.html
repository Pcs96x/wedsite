                    <h2>Gems version</h2>
                        <p> It all started with 'I want to, lick your face!' No, it is not what it sounds like, but it is a funny story. During the first, of many lock downs Phill had shared a post on 
                            facebook that said 'I want to...' then people had to autofill the next three words with whatever their phone suggested. Well, of course for some unknown reason, my autofill was 'lick your face' so I posted it and we got talking.
                            Me being stubborn old me waited for him to message me first but when he didn't, I took matters into my own hands and asked him out on a date! The first time we met in person, wasn't plain sailing either, I ran my mums car that low on fuel I
                             ended up breaking down about 20 yards from his. I would like to say Phill came to the rescue and fixed the car and we had a fantstic date...but we didn't. We met, we spoke for about 5 mins and that was it. Surely the quickest date ever?
                            
                            Enough of the jokes (although that really is the truth), I knew from that short space of time, how well we would get on. After around 6 months of dating, Phill stuck a post-it note in the back of my phone case asking if I would be
                            his girlfriend and the proposal was just as sweet... A trip down to the beach with our girls, all together as a family and he gets down on one knee in the rain and asks me to marry him. It was the easiest YES I have ever said.

                            It's crazy how one tiny decision can change your whole life.
                            I'd not been down here long before I got a job at Tower Arcade.
                            I was always in two minds about working at Tower, but I ended up there
                            and I'm grateful that I did. If I hadn't then I may not have met the absolute
                            love of my life. It all started with them looks you give when you see somebody
                            and think "WOW". I still remember the very first time I seen Gem walk through
                            the arcade. I remember thinking I had no chance! I was a floorwalker in an arcade...
                            I felt like a kid and she was this beautiful and sophisticated women that 
                            looked like she had her shit together. (oh how wrong i was haha) That's one 
                            of the reasons I never reached out to her. I definitely didn't have my shit
                            together then. Thankfully she made the move and added me on Facebook...
                            how she found me I don't know (the little stalker!) But even then I took my time and stopped
                            myself messaging first. Her reply on that Facebook post, "I want to..." was hilarious
                            and from then on we just clicked. It wasn't long before I found out that she wasn't
                            as sophisticated as I first thought haha But, she was still an amazing person... and at 
                            that point I knew I wanted her to stay in my life... Our relationship then just took off! We moved
                            in together after a few months and we've never looked back!
