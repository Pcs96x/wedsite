                    <h2>Church</h2>
                    <p>St Matthewâ€™s was built in the 1880s in the Victorian age and is a Grade 2 listed building of the early English style and built with Ancaster stone. 
                        Thanks to the 9th Earl of Scarborough it is uniquely placed in the centre of a roundabout.
                        The location was fine when the fastest vehicle was horse drawn, today getting to church can be more intrepid than Lord Scarborough intended!
                        However, all surrounding roads allow you to park all day, free of charge!

                    <p>The Vine Hotel is one of the oldest buildings in Skegness, dating back to when it was built and established in 1770.
                        Today, the vine sits in the middle of picturesque woodlands and has been refurbished to enhance its existing historic features. 
                        The Vine still retains a warm and welcoming ambience, making this the perfect venue for our recpetion.

                        it is stunning both inside and out!
