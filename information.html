                    <p>
                        The ceremony at St. Matthews Church is due
                        to start at 1pm. We are kindly asking that you
                        arrive at the church and are seated for 12:45pm, 
                        in order for timings to be adhered to.
                        When the ceremony is finished please make your
                        way straight to the reception and grab yourself a drink!

                    <p>
                        Please RSVP no later than the 14th of October.
                        Due to having to confirm numbers with the venue,
                        if we have not received your RSVP by then, unfortunately 
                        we will take this as you are unable to attend. Please head
                        over to our RSVP page to either confirm or decline 
                        your invitation.

                    <h2>INVITES ONLY</h2>
                        <p> Although we would like to be able to accommodate "plus ones" due
                            to venue capacity, only guests receiving this invitation will be able to attend
                            both the church and the reception. You will be notified if we have allocated you 
                            a plus one.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                    <h2>PHOTOS</h2>
                        <p> Whilst we do not mind you taking photos, please respect the bride and groom 
                            and not post anything on social media before we do. 
                            Also we kindly ask that you are mindful of the paid photographer.
                            Please could you send 
                            any photos or videos to: phillandgemmacoleman@gmail.com

                    <h2>Parking</h2>
                        <p>As you may have read in the church description, it is uniquely placed in 
                            the middle of a roundabout. This means that you can not park directly 
                            outside the church. However, on each of the four exits, one side 
                            of the road allows you to park all day and there is also a carpark
                             down Scarborough Avenue which is, roughly a 3 minute walk. 
                             Please allow time to get parked and walk to the church.
                            The Reception has its own private carpark.
                        </p>

                        <h2>ATTIRE</h2>
                        <p> We are kindly requesting a 'smart formal' attire to attend the church and reception. 
                            However we kindly ask that you avoid navy or champagne as these are the
                            reserved colours for the wedding party.
                        </p>

                        <h2>CHILDREN</h2>
                        <P> Having three gorgeous children between us means that our wedding will be
                            child friendly. Please note if you are a parent your invitation will include any children 
                            you have. We will be having a disco, a bouncy castle and a secure 
                            private garden at the Reception so children can let off some steam. 
                            But we kindly ask you that children are not left unattended. 
                        </P>

                        <h2>Staying over</h2>
                        <p>If you are choosing to stay over, The Vine Hotel has kindly 
                            allocated a select number of rooms for our guests and honoured 
                            them a reduced rate. 
                            You can ring The Vine Hotel and book for our wedding 
                            weekend by stating you're a wedding guest. 
                            There are also quite a few cheap B&B's located within a short 
                            walk from the reception, as well as a Premier Inn located on 
                            the sea front.

                     but, we have included local
                    taxi numbers just in case. Also the directions if you are driving
